# Forces due to bends in pipes

The momentum changes and the unbalanced internal pressure of the water leads to forces on the pipes.  The force diagram below helps to explain how the calculations where set for the variable angle. For the 90-degree angle, Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics 7th edition by Munson was used as reference.

# Summary

The purpose of this application is to determine the forces experienced on a pipe bend given the indicated parameters. To be used on oilfield applications since the volumetric flowrate is handled in barrels of production per day (one barrel of production is equivalent to 42 US gallons). Created using Android Developer Studio and Java. 

# Values needed

Density, pipe diameter, barrels per day flowing through pipe, Pressure (assuming p1 and p2 are equal), and angle.

# Results
The results are divided into components. The resultant is the vector sum of the x and y direction vectors.
