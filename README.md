# Forces due to bends in pipes

The changes in momentum and the unbalanced internal pressure of the water create forces on the pipes. The force diagram below illustrates how calculations were set up for the variable angle. For the 90-degree angle, Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, 7th edition, by Munson served as a reference.

# Summary

This application aims to determine the forces experienced on a pipe bend based on the specified parameters. It is designed for oilfield applications, where volumetric flow rate is measured in barrels of production per day (with one barrel equivalent to 42 US gallons). Developed using Android Developer Studio and Java.

# Values needed

Density, pipe diameter, barrels per day flowing through pipe, Pressure (assuming p1 and p2 are equal), and angle.

# Results
The results are divided into components. The resultant is the vector sum of the x and y direction vectors.
